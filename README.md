# BCGGetReq
The get request sent to BCG.

A very simple protocol was followed to get the JSON result back from the BCG Server using the API Key.     
Several slightly complex programming methods could've been used for the get and post request using several programming languages.  
  
For this particular case a simple get and post request to the BCG server using simple REST clients such as Postman or Insomnia was tested. Insomnia did a very well job with only merely 3-5 clicks and a bit of typing to get the JSON result back as it was only a one time thing.  
  
But this readme also specifies a progrmmable way to do the same thing.  
For "web's" sake I'll be using javascript and use "axios" for the get and post requests.
